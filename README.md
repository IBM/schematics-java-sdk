## Overview

The IBM Cloud Schematics Java SDK allows developers to programmatically interact with the following IBM Cloud services:

Service Name | Artifact Coordinates
--- | ---
[Schematics](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/schematics) | com.ibm.cloud:schematics:1.0.2 -->

## Prerequisites

[ibm-cloud-onboarding]: https://cloud.ibm.com/registration

* An [IBM Cloud][ibm-cloud-onboarding] account.
* An IAM API key to allow the SDK to access your account. Create one [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys).
* Java 8 or above.

## Installation
The current version of this SDK is: 1.0.2

Each service's artifact coordinates are listed in the table above.

The project artifacts are published on the following public maven repositories:
- [JCenter](https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter) - For information on how to use the
public JCenter maven repository, open [this link](https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter)
then click the `Set Me Up!` button.
- [Maven Central](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/) - This is the default public repository
used by maven when searching for dependencies.  To use this repository within your
gradle build, please see
[this link](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/declaring_repositories.html).

To use a particular service, define a dependency that contains the
artifact coordinates (group id, artifact id and version) for the service, like this:

##### Maven

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.ibm.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>schematics-service</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.2</version>
</dependency>
```

##### Gradle
```gradle
'com.ibm.cloud:schematics-service:1.0.2'
```

## Authentication

The library requires Identity and Access Management (IAM) to authenticate requests. There are several ways to set the properties for authentication

1. [As environment variables](#authenticate-with-environment-variables)
2. [The programmatic approach](#authenticate-programmatically)
3. [With an external credentials file](#authenticate-with-external-configuration)

### Authenticate with environment variables

For Schematics IAM authentication set the following environmental variables by replacing <apikey> with your proper service credentials. 

```
SCHEMATICS_URL = https://schematics.cloud.ibm.com
SCHEMATICS_APIKEY = <apikey>
```

### Authenticate with external configuration

To use an external configuration file, see the related documentation in the [Java SDK Core document about authentication](https://github.com/IBM/ibm-cloud-sdk-common/blob/master/README.md).

### Authenticate programmatically

To learn more about how to use programmatic authentication, see the related documentation in the [Java SDK Core document about authentication](https://github.com/IBM/ibm-cloud-sdk-common/blob/master/README.md).

## Getting Started

A quick example to get you up and running with Schematics Java SDK service

```

import com.ibm.cloud.schematics.v1.Schematics;
import com.ibm.cloud.schematics.v1.model.GetSchematicsVersionOptions;
import com.ibm.cloud.schematics.v1.model.VersionResponse;
import com.ibm.cloud.sdk.core.http.Response;
import com.ibm.cloud.sdk.core.security.IamAuthenticator;

Schematics service = null;
IamAuthenticator authenticator = new IamAuthenticator("<apiKey>");


service = new Schematics(Schematics.DEFAULT_SERVICE_NAME, authenticator);
service.setServiceUrl("https://schematics.cloud.ibm.com");

GetSchematicsVersionOptions getSchematicsVersionOptions = new GetSchematicsVersionOptions();

// Invoke operation
Response<VersionResponse> response = service.getSchematicsVersion(getSchematicsVersionOptions).execute();

VersionResponse versionResponseResult = response.getResult();

System.out.println(versionResponseResult);


```

## Error handling

For sample code on handling errors, please see [Schematics API docs](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/schematics#error-handling).
